Group Name
\[Interest/Task\] Group Charter
## 1 Convener
An interest/task group convener is responsible for: 
 - managing the group’s structure and processes
 - reporting to TDWG and the TDWG Executive Committee on the group’s activities; i.e., the primary point of contact for the group.  

Co-conveners may be designated, but having more than two is discouraged unless they maintain excellent communication and a fast pace of activity.

## 2 Core members
 - Members who supported the formation of the group and who have been or expect to be active in the group’s work.  
 - Core members should be cognizant of the group’s organization and plans, and should be able to explain to an outsider the purpose, justification and current state of work.
 - Indicate their role within the group wherever appropriate
 - Any core member could substitute for the Convener when required.
 - Core members are not necessarily people who contributed in the past. This is not a credits list. Active participants can and should be identified through contributions to discussion, as well as a separate list of contributors on any produced documents.
## 3 Motivation and scope
 - Why is this group needed? 
 - Describe the scope of the problems/solutions.

## 4 Goals, outputs, and outcomes
 - Interest Groups should have a few annual goals. 
 - Task groups should have specific deliverables and a schedule.
  o	Deliverables are outputs that can be used by people outside the group.
