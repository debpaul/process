Administrator, TDWG Secretariat

## Description

The Process repository facilitates collaborative development of documents that specify how TDWG operates.  The "TDWG Process" governs how people work together within TDWG to ensure that our standards are developed in an open fashion and that they reflect a consensus among stakeholders.  

Supplementary documents include:

 - template for interest and task group charters
 - template for annual reports from interest and task groups.
 
Documents relavant to the history of TDWG's process(es) may also be deposited here and linked from the wiki.
