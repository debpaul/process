Title: Guidelines for Review Managers of Proposed TDWG Standards

Date version issued: 2021-03-xx

Date created: 2009-05-15

Part of TDWG Standard: Not part of any standard

Abstract: The guidelines for review managers of proposed standards were originally written in 2009 by Lee Belbin and since then have been used by review managers of most of the standards that have been ratified since then. They were revised in 2021 based on feedback from former review managers in order to update the recommendations based on changes in technology and practical experience. They describe the best practices for carrying out the expert and public reviews required as part of the TDWG Process, the bylaws that govern how TDWG standards are ratified.

# 1 Responsibilities

TDWG has a process for the ratification of its standards (<https://www.tdwg.org/about/process/>) that is part of the TDWG Constitution (<https://www.tdwg.org/about/constitution/>). TDWG's constitution and standards review process relies on consensus.

## 1.1 TDWG Executive Committee

The **TDWG Executive Committee** has responsibility for

1. Appointing a Review Manager
2. Approving submissions for Public Review
3. Ratifying a submission as a TDWG standard

The Executive Committee may also make recommendations for Reviewers but the final decision for selecting reviewers is up to the Review Manager.

## 1.2 Review Manager

The **Review Manager**

1. Manages the process of review.
2. Understands the process required for an effective review (Section 5.1).
3. Does not need to be a technical developer but does need to have a good overview of the proposed standard. A prospective user of the standard should make for an effective Review Manager.
4. Recruits Independent Reviewers from the TDWG or related communities.
5. Communicates effectively with the TDWG Executive Committee, Reviewers and other interested parties.
6. Expedites the review process within the time requirements of the constitution.

## 1.3 Independent Reviewers

The **Independent Reviewers**

| [See issue #3](https://github.com/tdwg/process/issues/3) expert review comments |
| :--- |
| *Need to edit #1.3.1 if we want to have the option of non-anonymous expert review.* |

1. Should be anonymous to all but the Review Manager during the review process.
2. Are expected to have a high level of understanding of the domain and of the technical issues related to the proposed standard.
3. Provide an unbiased assessment on the proposed standard.
4. Report to the Review Manager in a timely manner.

# 2 TDWG Standards Track

| [See issue #5](https://github.com/tdwg/process/issues/5) tracking system |
| :--- |
| *Replace obsolete text here about OJS with some mechanism having the following features: archive of record of review, potential for confidentiality when necessary/desirable, ability to be turned over to any replacement manager.* |

The Review Manager must ensure that:-

A\. The submission conforms to the TDWG Standards Specification (<http://rs.tdwg.org/sds/doc/specification/>). The file/s used in the review process should-

| [See issue #9](https://github.com/tdwg/process/issues/9) file formats |
| :--- |
| *Replace obsolete text here about formats with something about Google Docs or Word docs with track changes capabilities. There really does not need to be a connection between the format used by the independent reviewers and the ultimate format for display (which currently will be Markdown, but could be something else in the future).* |

B\. That the Author has placed the submission in the correct standards category
- Technical Specification,
- Applicability Statement or
- Best Current Practice

C\. That the metadata information under the Summary is accurate and complete. The metadata will be used 'as is' to populate components of the TDWG web site when the submission is approved.


# 3 Independent Reviews

One of the first tasks for the Review Manager is to seek reviewers for the submission. Advice can be sought from the Author, relevant TDWG groups, the Executive Committee and others. It is recommended that at least three reviews are provided for submissions.

## 3.1 Reviewer Profile

The **ideal reviewer** is someone who has not been directly involved in the development of the standard (independence). Reviewers must have advanced technical skills as a standard is a technical document. The ideal reviewer has written or contributed to the development of another standard. An ideal reviewer 'gets the job done'.

While it is appropriate to seek reviewers from different communities/disciplines, this is less important than their technical abilities. Ideally, good reviewers will have experience in a range of areas/applications.

It would be hoped that at least two of the reviews would provide a comprehensive check of all of the technical details of the proposed standard. With a complex standard, this will take time.

| [See issue #5](https://github.com/tdwg/process/issues/5) tracking system |
| :--- |
| *Replace obsolete text here about archiving correspondence in OJS with some alternative method, probably involving GitHub.* |

An example of an email request to potential reviewers can be found as Appendix in section 5.2: Please use something like this as the email content.

The timeframe for individual reviewers to respond is up to you as Review manager. A period of around **one month** would be reasonable given that the review task may be substantial. Reviewers' submissions should be timely. If a Reviewer is not able to complete the review within a reasonable timeframe, another Reviewer may need to be engaged. You may want to have a reviewer or two 'up your sleeve' in case of missed deadlines. Once a deadline has been passed, send a reminder and in parallel, consider seeking an additional reviewer. This way, there are minimal holdups.

## 3.2 Review Criteria

What **criteria** should you convey to reviewers to judge a submission? A TDWG standard is a document, but consideration should be given in the review of how effectively the proposed standard could be implemented.

- The key issue for reviewers is that the proposed TDWG standard efficiently addresses the community need. Does the submission achieve the intended outcome in an efficient and effective manner?
- Is the submission clearly written? If not, then uptake of the standard, however technically capable it is, will be diminished. Is the document itself structured in a way that will facilitate understanding by the broadest audience? Each standard document must clearly indicate what parts of it are normative. This may be done by designation at the start of the document (e.g. "all parts of the document excluding examples marked as non-normative") or by indicating at the start of particular sections whether they are normative or not. See Section 3.2.1 of the Standards Documentation Specification for details.
- Does the submission conform to the TDWG Standards Specification?
- Does the submission detail the intended audience and its needs? This should be addressed in a preamble and is required for a reviewer to evaluate how well the standard meets its goals. If the audience and desired outcomes are not identified, it is impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed standard.
- Is the proposed standard technically accurate? For a complex standard, this is not an easy thing to evaluate. Some of the reviewers need to be technically capable of systematically examining the proposed standard to ensure that it is accurate. Typos, unexpanded first use of acronyms and undefined jargon in a technical document present a significant hazards to the end-users.
- Does the submission build upon effective existing standards? Proposed standards should not 'reinvent the wheel'. They should re-use well-accepted and effective standards wherever possible. Are other existing standards more appropriate for the intended purpose?
- Is the overall structure of the standard effective? If the structure of the proposed standard is problematic, then use of the standard may be equally problematic. Are there ways to simplify the structure? Does the structure allow for efficient/effective extensibility?
- Does the standard address a large majority of end-user needs? Are the fields/parameters sufficient and clearly defined? Are the parameters/fields sufficient to address the large majority of end-user needs?

## 3.3 Post Review

Once all reviews are in, it is up to you to look at the reviews and decide into which category to place the submission.

- Accept submission (as is), which would be rare,
- Revisions required (which would be the norm),
- Resubmit for a new review (rare) or
- Decline submission (even rarer)

| [See issue #4](https://github.com/tdwg/process/issues/4) public review comments & [issue #5](https://github.com/tdwg/process/issues/5) tracking system |
| :--- |
| *(Consider recommendations here for options for tracking comments.)* |

Inform the Author what if any steps need to be taken before seeking approval from the Executive Committee to advance the submission to Public Review. **~~If reviewers have used Word's Track Changes, then the documents are not anonymous.~~ You may need to export these reviews into a format that maintains reviewer anonymity to the Author. ~~You can for example, use Save As in Word and use the Security button to remove personal information.~~** You may wish to combine all salient parts of reviews into a single document for the Author.

Subsequent reviews (by the engaged Reviewers) is usual.

As the Process dictates, the final decision for advancing the submission to Public Review is in the hands of the Executive Committee. An email should therefore then be sent to [secretariat@tdwg.org](mailto:secretariat@tdwg.org) for distribution to the Executive Committee. The email should request a decision concerning progress to Public Review. The Executive will discuss the submission and provide a decision within 30 days.

# 4 Public Review

The public review is complementary to the individual reviews. **Public comment must be open for at least 30 days (see Section 5.1).** Anyone except the Review Manager can post comments to the Public Review. The reason for this is that it is important for the Review Manager to remain independent in the public eye. It is the Review Manager who makes the two key recommendations to the TDWG Executive Committee. The Author is free to post comments as a response to the other comments posted.

To advance the submission to public review, an acceptable set of documents must have been submitted by the Author to the Review Manager.

| [See issue #10](https://github.com/tdwg/process/issues/10) submission materials |
| :--- |
| *Replace obsolete text here with text describing options for making the submission visible to the public during the period of the review. This should include some sort of landing page that explains the history and status of the proposed standard -- what commenters will see to guide them to the standards documents that they will be reviewing. It should also provide instructions for commenting.* |

| [See issue #6](https://github.com/tdwg/process/issues/6) mechanisms to alert the community |
| :--- |
| *Replace obsolete text here with text describing mechanisms for informing the community about the subject of the ongoing review, deadlines, and where to go to contribute a review. The existing text about the TDWG homepage and email lists can be included, but other forms of communication like the TDWG newsletter, Twitter, watchers of the Task Group's Github repo, etc. should be added.* |

A news item should be added by the Author to the initiating group's home page on the TDWG site, and the Review Manager should send the same announcement to at least the TDWG and Taxacom email lists and potentially other web sites such as GBIF. A copy of a previous announcement can be found as Section 5.2. Contact [secretariat@tdwg.org](mailto:secretariat@tdwg.org) for any assistance.

Public comment may result in all of the following -

- Positive suggestions that will improve and enhance the utility of the standard
- Suggestions that will add unnecessary complexity or diversions
- Recommendations that will advocate significant/fundamental changes to the submission
- Negative comment that shows bias or lack of understanding of the intent of the proposed standard

Note: If possible, constructive comments should be acknowledged by the Review Manager.

| [See issue #4](https://github.com/tdwg/process/issues/4) public review comments |
| :--- |
| *We need to review the following section in light of our discussions about confidential vs. public commenting.* |

Public Review comments are openly visible to all. Comments are normaly posted by and identified to the commenter. Anonymous comments can when justified be communicated to and posted by the Review Manager on behalf of the commenter. The Author can examine comments, discuss issues with the Review Manager, and prepare responses or changes once the first comment is posted.

An issue tracking system can be used in the public review. The basic requirement is that

- The public can view and _easily_ comment on the proposal.
- That all comments can be identified to an individual with at least an email address (which is at least known to the Review Manager).
- That a log of all comments is maintained ~~can be uploaded to *(somewhere in Github)*~~ so that the process is fully logged for future reference.

When the review period is up, the Review Manager needs to inform [secretariat@tdwg.org](mailto:secretariat@tdwg.org) and create a document that **adds a recommended action against each** comment that could include (with any further explanation as necessary):

- Accept comment and implement the suggestion,
- Accept comment but adds no significant addition to the proposal, or
- Reject comment.

It is then up to the Author to respond to the Review Manager concerning all comments and associated recommendations. The Review Manager examines the Author's responses and any updated submission. One of two actions are then selected for the submission:-

- A recommendation to the Executive Committee (via the Secretariat) that the standard be accepted or

- A recommendation to the Author that further work on the standard is required.

A number of iterations may be required before a recommendation to accept the proposal is made to the Executive Committee.

## 5.1 TDWG Constitution - Ratification of Standards

1. When a Task Group believes that a working draft is ready for wider review, the Task Group Convener submits the working draft and appropriate documentation as a package to the Executive Committee via the Secretary.
2. The Secretary notifies the Executive Committee of the submission and requests a decision on advancing the draft. This decision must be made within 30 days of receipt of the draft.
  - If the response is positive, the Executive Committee appoints a Review Manager to seek appropriate independent and expert reviews.
  - If the response is negative, the Secretary reports the decision with justification to the Task Group Convener.
3. The Review Manager submits the reviews along with a summary and recommendation as a package to the Executive Committee.
4. The Executive Committee may
  - advance the draft as a Proposed Standard with call for public comment, or
  - decline (with justification) to advance the draft, or
  - request a new revision to address specific problems.
5. Public Review. The Executive Committee directs the Proposed Standard to be placed in the TDWG repository, publishes a request for comment (RFC) that describes facilities for, and duration of public comment. A minimum of 30 days must be allowed for comment. At the end of the comment period, the Task Group may modify the specification or its documentation as necessary. Any subsequent submission should address the comments received in the public review.
6. Accept as a Standard - A draft is accepted as a Standard and its status in the repository is updated accordingly. A specification must have been through at least one round of public review before the Executive Committee may accept it as a Standard.

| *I have left here what bits were left over after I deleted outdated mechanisms. Do we actually want to provide a template, or just links to copies of the previous announcements that we have recovered and let the review manager create their own version?* |

**{standardName} Public Review**

By: *what? review manager? executive?*

TDWG announces the Public Review of the proposed {standardName} standard. It has been reviewed by the TDWG Executive Committee and we now seek comment from the community.

The standard's abstract can be found here: x

A brief set of guidelines for reviewers can be found in the document *(originally links to these guidelines, but I think a simplified set of guidelines is more appropriate.)*. These questions provide guidance: They are not exhaustive.



In accordance with the TDWG 'Process', a minimum of 30 days is required for public comment on the proposed standard. Comments should therefore be received by XXXX. Comments can be anonymous by *(revise to eliminate inconsistency between saying the reviews can be anonymous but must have an identified author)*

Please distribute this call for comment to anyone you think could or should comment on the {standardName} standard.
